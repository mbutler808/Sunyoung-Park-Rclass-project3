The folders in Data should contain all of the data used in this project. 

The `Data` is being loaded/manipulated/reshaped/saved using code from the `Code` folder. 

## Raw Data

Data cleaning is done in code, which archives of all of the cleaning steps.


### Data Entry Check

Festuca Mairei was eliminated from the list of species due to its inadequate sample size. 
Now there is 13 plant species, instead of 14 species, for analysis.

* `processeddata.rda` is the cleaned version of the data.
* `processeddata.csv` is the cleaned version of the data.
* `dictionary.csv` is a data dictionary for the cleaned data.
